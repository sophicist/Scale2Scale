What type of income generation or business is this?

RF-EL-170 We would like to hear which of your income sources are still active. We will read out each business to record the current situation.

```{r}
x <- end[,grep("Gender|Q_17_[0-9]$",names(end))]

# Employment

Do you have any form of employment? (think of all types of work that is (sometimes) paid, also informal work, including a few hours of babysitting, working for friends...)

```{r}

```

RF-EL-210 We would like to hear which of your employments are currently active. We will read out each type of employment and ask you what the current situation is.
